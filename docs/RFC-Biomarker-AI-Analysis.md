**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Author:** Requirements Analyst  
**Status:** Draft for Review  

---

## Overview

This document specifies requirements for a standalone CLI application that automatically analyzes biomarker gene-pair data to identify statistically sound and clinically promising sepsis/septic shock biomarkers. The system will process CSV files containing 10,000+ gene pairs, apply configurable statistical thresholds, and generate Excel reports with AI-driven recommendations.

### Problem Statement
Currently, biomarker analysis requires manual review of statistical metrics, biological relevance, and clinical progression patterns across thousands of gene pairs. This is time-intensive and prone to inconsistent evaluation criteria.

### Solution Approach
Develop an AI system that mimics expert meta-analyst workflows by:
- Performing automated statistical validation checks
- Evaluating biological plausibility using external APIs and AI
- Assessing clinical progression potential
- Generating detailed rationale reports for each gene pair

## Goals

### Primary Goals
- **Automation**: Reduce manual review time from days to hours for large datasets
- **Consistency**: Apply standardized evaluation criteria across all gene pairs
- **Transparency**: Provide detailed rationale for each recommendation
- **Scalability**: Handle 10,000+ gene pairs per analysis run

### Secondary Goals
- **Configurability**: Allow threshold adjustments without code changes
- **Robustness**: Handle API failures gracefully with fallback analysis
- **Accuracy**: Maintain high precision in identifying promising biomarkers

---

## Assumptions

1. **Input Data**: CSV format matches the provided sample structure with 38 columns
2. **Compute Resources**: System has sufficient memory/CPU for batch processing large datasets
3. **Network Access**: Internet connectivity available for external API calls (with fallback capability)
4. **User Expertise**: Single user has bioinformatics domain knowledge for threshold configuration
5. **Gene Nomenclature**: Gene symbols follow standard HGNC naming conventions
6. **Statistical Framework**: Meta-analysis statistics (Cohen's d, I², p-values) are properly calculated in input data

As a biomarker researcher,
I want to process a CSV file with 15,000 gene pairs,
So that I can identify promising sepsis biomarkers efficiently.

Acceptance Criteria:
- System processes file within 30 minutes
- Generates Excel report with results
- Flags any data quality issues
- Provides progress updates during processing
```

**Story 2: Configuration Management**
```
As a domain expert,
I want to adjust statistical thresholds (p-value, I², effect size),

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements
- Process 10,000 gene pairs within 30 minutes on standard hardware
- Memory usage should not exceed 4GB for typical datasets
- Support concurrent API calls with rate limiting

### Configuration Schema
```yaml
thresholds:
  statistical:
    max_p_value: 0.001
    max_heterogeneity: 50.0
    min_studies: 2
    min_effect_size: 0.2
  
scoring:
  weights:
    statistical: 0.5
    biological: 0.5
  
api_settings:
  timeout: 30
  retry_attempts: 3
  fallback_mode: true
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Validate all inputs before processing begins
- Use circuit breaker pattern for external API calls
- Provide specific error messages with suggested fixes
- Log all errors with timestamps and context
